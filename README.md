# ear-detector

This repository contains all code that was written for an ear detector. Datasets are not included as it is not a good practice to store on github a large amount of raw data. If anyone is interested in the data that was used for training the classifier, feel free to contact me via email: zan@magerl.si.

# Directory structure

## figures
Folder `figures` contains results (in the form of `.csv` file) of different models on the test dataset. Folder also contains some plots that were used for the report.

## testing_different_datasets
This folder has same structure as `best_model` folder. It contains all needed data to reproduce mine results.
